title: Books I have read
---

I am an avid reader and a lifelong learner. In this post, I'll maintain a list of books I have read. For now, I will be just writing the name of the books. Later, I would like to make this page more beautiful (similar to [this page](https://jameskle.com/reads)) by adding images of books I have read.

### 2018

1. Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman
2. Good to Great
3. Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
4. Think and Grow Rich
